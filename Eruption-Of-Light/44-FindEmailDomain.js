/**************** 
 * An email address such as "John.Smith@example.com" is made up of a local part ("John.Smith"), an "@" symbol, then a domain part ("example.com").

The domain name part of an email address may only consist of letters, digits, hyphens and dots. The local part, however, also allows a lot of different special characters. Here you can look at several examples of correct and incorrect email addresses.

Given a valid email address, find its domain part.

Example

For address = "prettyandsimple@example.com", the output should be
solution(address) = "example.com";
For address = "fully-qualified-domain@codesignal.com", the output should be
solution(address) = "codesignal.com".

function helloWorld(name) {
    console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");

const solution = address => {
    return address.split("@")[address.split("@").length-1];
}
