/******************* 
 * Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

Example

For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be
solution(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190].

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] array.integer a

If a[i] = -1, then the ith position is occupied by a tree. Otherwise a[i] is the height of a person standing in the ith position.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ a.length ≤ 1000,
-1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000.

[output] array.integer

Sorted array a with all the trees untouched.

[JavaScript] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
function helloWorld(name) {
    console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    return "Hello, " + name;
}
*****************/
const solution = a => {
    let sorted_arr = [...a].sort( (a,b)=>a-b ).filter(n=>n!==-1);
    for(let i=0; i<a.length; i++) {
        if(a[i]!==-1) a[i] = sorted_arr.shift();
    }
    return a;
