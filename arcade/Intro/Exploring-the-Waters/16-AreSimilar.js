/*******************
 Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
solution(a, b) = true.

The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
solution(a, b) = true.

We can obtain b from a by swapping 2 and 1 in b.

For a = [1, 2, 2] and b = [2, 1, 1], the output should be
solution(a, b) = false.

Any swap of any two elements either in a or in b won't make a and b equal.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] array.integer a

Array of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
3 ≤ a.length ≤ 105,
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000.

[input] array.integer b

Array of integers of the same length as a.

Guaranteed constraints:
b.length = a.length,
1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 1000.

[output] boolean

true if a and b are similar, false otherwise.

[JavaScript] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
function helloWorld(name) {
    console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    return "Hello, " + name;
}
* ******************/
const solution = (a,b)=> {
    // if arrays don't have same elements 
    const arr1 = [...a], arr2 = [...b];
    arr1.sort(); 
    arr2.sort();
    if(arr1.join('')!==arr2.join('')) return false;

    // if arrays have same elements 
    let diff = 0;
    for(let i=0; i<a.length; i++) {
        if(a[i]!==b[i]) diff++;
    }
    return diff>2 ? false : true;
