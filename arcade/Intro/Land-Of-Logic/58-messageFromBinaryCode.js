/******** 
 * You are taking part in an Escape Room challenge designed specifically for programmers. In your efforts to find a clue, you've found a binary code written on the wall behind a vase, and realized that it must be an encrypted message. After some thought, your first guess is that each consecutive 8 bits of the code stand for the character with the corresponding extended ASCII code.

Assuming that your hunch is correct, decode the message.

Example

For code = "010010000110010101101100011011000110111100100001", the output should be
solution(code) = "Hello!".

The first 8 characters of the code are 01001000, which is 72 in the binary numeral system. 72 stands for H in the ASCII-table, so the first letter is H.
Other letters can be obtained in the same manner.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] string code

A string, the encrypted message consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 < code.length < 800.

[output] string

The decrypted message.

[JavaScript] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
function helloWorld(name) {
    console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    return "Hello, " + name;
}

const solution = code => {
    const arr = [];
    code = code.split("");
    while(code.length>0) {
        arr.push( code.slice(0, 8).join("") );
        code.splice(0, 8);
    }
    return arr.map(b => String.fromCharCode(parseInt(b, 2))).join("")
